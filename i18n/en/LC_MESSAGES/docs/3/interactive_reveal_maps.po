"This tutorial shows how to use a dynamic mask layer in a layer group "
"along with expressions to make an interactive map that reveal the layers "
"beneath the current layer as you move your cursor around. This is done "
"using the new `mask blending modes "
"<https://changelog.qgis.org/en/entry/2154>`_ in QGIS along with technique"
" for adding interactivity shown in the previous tutorial on "
":doc:`interactive_canvas_maps`."

"We will start by loading 2 raster layers. One layer at the top and "
"another one at the bottom that will be revealed by the mask layer. We "
"will get these from the QuickMapServices plugin. Search and install the "
"**QuickMapServices** plugin from the QGIS Official Plugin Repository. See"
" :doc:`using_plugins` for instructions on installing plugins. Once "
"installed, we will need to add some additional service to this plugin. Go"
