"Most GIS projects require georeferencing some raster data. "
"*Georeferencing* is the process of assigning real-world coordinates to "
"each pixel of the raster. Many times these coordinates are obtained by "
"doing field surveys - collecting coordinates with a GPS device for few "
"easily identifiable features in the image or map. In some cases, where "
"you are looking to digitize scanned maps, you can obtain the coordinates "
"from the markings on the map image itself. Using these sample coordinates"
" or GCPs ( Ground Control Points ), the image is warped and made to fit "
"within the chosen coordinate system. In this tutorial I will discuss the "
"concepts, strategies and tools within QGIS to achieve a high accuracy "
"georeferencing."

"1.Georeferencing in QGIS is done via the **Georeferencer GDAL** plugin. "
"This is a core plugin - meaning it is already part of your QGIS "
"installation. You just need to enable it. Go to :menuselection:`Plugins "
"--> Manage and Install Plugins` and enable the :guilabel:`Georeferencer "
"GDAL` plugin in the :guilabel:`Installed` tab. See "
":doc:`../using_plugins` for more details on how to work with plugins."

"In the next screen, you will asked to choose the raster’s coordinate "
"reference system (CRS). This is to specify the projection and datum of "
"your control points. If you have collected the ground control points "
"using a GPS device, you would have the WGS84 CRS. If you are geo-"
"referencing a scanned map like this, you can obtain the CRS information "
"from the map itself. Looking at our map image, the coordinates are in "
"Latitude/Longitude. There is no datum information given, so we have to "
"assume an appropriate one. Since it is India and the map is quite old, we"
" can bet the Everest 1830 datum would give us good results."

"Back in the :guilabel:`Georeferencer` window, you will notice that the "
"GCPs now have a non-zero ``dX``, ``dY`` and ``Residual`` error values. "
"``Thin Plate Splite`` will deform the image to exactly match the GCPs, so"
" you will not see large error values when using this transform. One tip "
"to check the accuracy of your work is to temporarily change the "
"trasofrmation settings in :menuselection:`Settings --> Transformation "
"Settings` to ``Linear`` or ``Polynomial`` and see how these error values "
"change. If a particular GCP has unusually high error values, that usually"
" means a human-error in entering the coordinate values. So you can delete"
" that GCP and capture it again. You can also edit the coordinate values "
"in the :guilabel:`GCP Table` by clicking the cell in either "
":guilabel:`Dest. X` or :guilabel:`Dest. Y` columns. Once you are "
"satisfied with the GCPs, switch back to the ``Thin Plate Spline`` "
"transformation type and go to :menuselection:`File --> Start "
"georeferencing`. This will start the process of warping the image using "
"the GCPs and creating the target raster."

"source like the Natural Earth dataset and compare them. You will notice "
