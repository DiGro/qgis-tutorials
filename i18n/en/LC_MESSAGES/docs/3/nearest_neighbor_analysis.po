"GIS is very useful in analyzing spatial relationship between features. "
"One such analysis is finding out which features are closest to a given "
"feature. There are multiple ways to do this analysis in QGIS. You can do "
"a spatial join using the **Join Attributes by Nearest** or get the "
"distances to all features from another layer using the **Distance "
"Matrix** tool from the Processing Toolbox.  In this tutorial, we will "
"explore a tool named **Distance to nearest hub** from the Processing "
"Toolbox that can not only find the distance to the closest feature but "
"join it with a line to it for visualizing the results."
