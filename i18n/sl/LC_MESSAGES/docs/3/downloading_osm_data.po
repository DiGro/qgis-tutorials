"Getting high quality data is essential for any GIS task. One great resource "
"for free and openly licensed data is `OpenStreetMap(OSM) "
"<http://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ . The OSM database consists of all types "
"of mapping data - streets, local data, building polygons, administrative "
"boundaries etc. Getting access to OSM data in a GIS format in QGIS is "
"possible via the *QuickOSM** plugin. This tutorial explains the process for "
"searching, downloading and using this plugin."
