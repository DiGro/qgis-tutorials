"OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a crowd-sourced global dataset of roads, boundaries, "
"buildings and more. It has a growing collection of building footprints "
"across the world with many of them also having height information. While the"
" accuracy of building height data is notoriously difficult to validate for "
"analysis, we can use QGIS expressions to create a fun artistic isometric "
"rendering from this data."
