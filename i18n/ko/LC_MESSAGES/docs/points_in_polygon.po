"In QGIS3, you can perform this analysis using the ``Join attributes by "
"location (summary)`` tool in the Processing Toolbox. Use the polygon layer "
"as the :guilabel:`Input Layer`, the point layer as the :guilabel:`Join "
"layer` and ``count``  as the :guilabel:`Summaries to calculate`. See "
":doc:`3/performing_spatial_joins` tutorial for step-by-step instructions."
